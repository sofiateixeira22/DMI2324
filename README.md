## Project Description
A bank is aiming to enhance its customer service quality. One particular challenge it faces is the ambiguity surrounding the identification of good clients (those eligible for additional services) and bad clients (those requiring close monitoring to mitigate potential losses). The bank stores data of its clients, including information on their accounts (comprising transactions spanning several months), previously granted loans, and issued credit cards.

This project aims to use data mining techniques on [this](/dataset/) data set to help bank managers better understand their clients and identify which type of client makes a good candidate for a credit card.

Two problems should be addressed: one descriptive and one predictive. While the descriptive problem remains open-ended, the predictive challenge is determining whether a loan will end successfully.

## Task 1: Data Understanding and Preparation
This task involves summarizing and visualizing the data to provide valuable insights. Consider questions that could be interesting to check with the available data and provide answers using textual summaries or data visualization. Based on this analysis, you should also check if it is necessary to carry out any data clean-up and pre-processing steps.
